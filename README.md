## About Me

I help finance leaders modernize their FP&A processes through practical automation, AI-driven forecasting, and better decision-making systems.

Through CloudCraft Solutions, I combine deep financial expertise with technical know-how—bringing together AI tools, cloud-based automation, and real-world strategy. I’ve worked as a VP in operational strategy, led multi-million-dollar finance initiatives, and built internal reporting systems that scale.

My mission is simple: help finance teams do more with less by bridging technology and financial insight.
